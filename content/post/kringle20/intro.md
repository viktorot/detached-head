The holidays are time for friends, family and most of all, doing CTF challenges.<br> 

So when this year's holidays rolled up (technically last year's, because this will be published in 2021), I couldn't miss the opportunity to participate in [SANS Holiday Hack](https://2020.kringlecon.com/) challenge, having missed it the prior year.
The Holiday Hack challenge is one of the most fun CTF challenges that one can participate in around the holidays.<br>

The whole challenge is structured around a mysterious villain, trying to ruin Christmas. It is our job to find out who the villain is and save Christmas.

The CTF consisted of 12 main objectives, 7 terminal challenges and 4 mini games. 
The challenges were accompanied by video talks as part of [KringleCon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNiR-C_VXv_TCFgww5Vczag), that introduced new topics and provided hints for some of the challenges.<br>
